      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a digital marketing professional with ~20 years of experience, and a full stack developer and programmer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in KY. Grew up in Winston-Salem, NC.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a parent of 2, so my hobbies are whatever my kids or wife is into. :)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Why, a software developer of course. And of course a "dad", which I've been lucky enough to be for 10 years now.  </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Greensboro, NC</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Slightly longer story:</p>
      <p>I've been on the business-side/hiring manager-side for years. I started out in teaching, then moved to advertising, then to digital marketing, and eventually to be a director of web and ecommerce at a global top 10 leadership development institution. (Stay with me, I'll get there.)</p>
      <p>In that role, I set priority for scrum teams specialized in .NET and C++, C#. And working with developers, weighing in, and eventually hiring managers played into my gathering a broad general knowledge of development across a number of languages - client and server-side. But other than random scripts and experiments, my coding has been limited to HTML and CSS for the most part (other than a stint with ActionScript that I went pretty deep into, but we won't talk about that).</p>
      <p>The result is that I've been closely linked to development in a career of ~20 years, but was an outsider to actually the developing, syntax, and fundamental language nuances.  I was instead "the business unit" - and have relied on contractors, or hacking code from StackOverflow examples, or overusing WYSIWYG editors and adjustable themes to create products through platforms like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc. to accomplish myriad needs and project.</p>
      <p>After full-time roles in management in the public and private section, I've been freelancing and contracting for years now (mostly business consulting and digital marketing). But a blind person can see a clear need and opportunity in the marketplace looming on the horizon as we head to a "new normal" resulting for global business shut-downs, workforce quarantine, and deep recession.  This new normal will rely heavily on distributed workforces and virtual, asynchronous service and product delivery.</p>
      <p>But that's the businessy response. I am entrepreneural by nature, and creating is not a desire, but a need as desperate as breathing to me. I have as COO of a startup in seed rounds right now. I am a marketer (MBA with ~20 years experience), <span style="text-decoration: underline">message</span>r (art with words), graphic designer (full Adobe stack), and the one medium I haven't delved into to my satisfaction mdash; the one I've passionately wanted to for decades &mdash; is progamming and development. It is the cross-roads of creation, artful results derived from language translation, and pure utility &mdash; in which the end result isn't something just to sit back and enjoy observing, but rather is something that can be engaged with at infinitely deep levels - as deeply as the programmmer (or teams of programmers) can envision and create.</p>
      <p>See, I truly connect with and love the HTML and CSS coding that I do (and do pretty well). But I see this as not only a necessary medium in this global environment that I must develop in order to be competitive, but quite frankly it's a necessary medium for me to master so that I can create and thrive and satisfy this impulse that drives me and draws me to programming. I simply can't ignore it. A polyglot programmer is my <em>destiny</em>, so to speak.</p>
